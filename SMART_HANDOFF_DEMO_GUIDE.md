## 🔧 **Technical Deep Dive**

### **AI Prompt Engineering**
```javascript
// Example of sophisticated prompting
const prompt = `
CRITICAL COMPONENT GENERATION RULES:
1. Generate self-contained React components
2. Use semantic HTML elements
3. Include accessibility attributes
4. Calculate precise positioning
5. Extract exact values from Figma data
`;
```

### **Positioning Algorithm**
```javascript
// Smart positioning calculation
const relativePosition = {
  left: child.x - parent.x,
  top: child.y - parent.y,
  position: 'absolute'
};
```

### **Accessibility Enhancement**
```javascript
// Automatic ARIA attribute generation
const accessibilityProps = {
  'aria-label': componentLabel,
  'aria-required': isRequired,
  'role': semanticRole,
  'tabIndex': isInteractive ? 0 : -1
};
```
